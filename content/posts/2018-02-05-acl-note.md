# Linux ACL - Access Control List

## Commands

- `setfacl`
- `getfacl`

## ACL

### Permission

    - Comma separated entry.
    - Each entry consists of type, value and permissions, separated by colon.
        - type is one of `u` (user), `g` (group), `o` (other), `m` (mask)
        - value is the user name or uid for `u`, group name or gid for `g`, nothing for `o`
        - permissions is the combination of `r` (read), `w` (write) and `e` (execute)
        - if value is empty, then means all users/groups
        - if no read permission is to granted, the replace `r` with `-` for read char
        - if no write permission is to granted, the replace `w` with `-` for read char
        - if no execute permission is to granted, the replace `x` with `-` for read char
        - `-` in value can be ommited, if at least one of `r`, `w` and `x` is
          present: `r-x` => `rx`
        - at least one `-` in value must be present if none of `r`, `w` and `x`
          is present: `---` => `-`
    - e.g., `u:wb:rwx`, `u::rwx`

### File & Directory ACL

#### User ACL

    - For file owner: `u::rwx`
    - For user with username 'aaa': `u:aaa:rwx`
    - For user with uid '2000': `u:2000:rwx`

#### Group ACL

    - For file owner: `g::rwx`
    - For user with username 'aaa': `g:aaa:rwx`
    - For user with uid '2000': `g:2000:rwx`

#### Other ACL

    - For file owner: `o::rwx`
    - For user with username 'aaa': `o:aaa:rwx`
    - For user with uid '2000': `o:2000:rwx`

#### Mask acl

    - The effective acl is the intersection of given acl and mask acl
    - e.g., if `m::r-x` and `u:wb:rwx`, the the effective acl for wb is `u:wb:r-x`

### Default acl

For directory, newly create files can inherited from the parent directory if
default acl set for the parent directory.

## THe Way to Set ACL

### Add ACL Entry

```
setfacl -m 'u:wb:rwx,g:wb:r-x' a.file
```

### Remove ACL Entry

```
setfacl -x 'u:wb:rwx,g:wb:r-x' a.file
```

### Override Existing ACL Entries

```
setfacl --set 'u:wb:rwx,g:wb:r-x:o::r--' a.file
```

### Clear ACL Entries

```
setfacl -b a.file
```

### Apply ACL Recursively

```
setfacl -R -m 'u:wb:rwx,g:wb:r-x' a.file
```

### Change Default ACL

```
setfacl -d -m 'u:wb:rwx,g:wb:r-x' a.file
```

## Get ACL

```
getfacl a.file
```
